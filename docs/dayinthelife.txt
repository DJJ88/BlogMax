This page describes how I use BlogMax to maintain my weblog,
<a href="http://billstclair.com/blog/index.html">
End the War on Freedom</a>. I spend an hour or two most days reading
news and inserting links and commentary into the day's weblog page.

My typing is indented and in:
<blockquote>
<code><b>
bold code font
</b></code>.
</blockquote>
Text in the blog is indented and in:
<blockquote>
<code>
code font
</code>
</blockquote>

To begin, look at the calendar. Today is 9 June, 2001. In yymmdd
language, that's 010609. So I open that text file in my weblog
directory:
<blockquote>
<code><b>
C-x C-f e:/editthispage/010609.txt
</b></code>
</blockquote>
Next I traverse my daily links. Let's suppose I find a story at
LewRockwell.com, say a new Patricia Neill article. I copy the article
link from my web browser's address line, go back to Emacs, and paste
it in:
<blockquote>
<code><b>
C-M-a
</b></code>
</blockquote>
At this point, my Emacs buffer looks something like:
<blockquote>
<code>
&lt;a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/neill/neill23.html"><br>
&lt;/a>
</code>
</blockquote>
Copy the story title form the web browser, and paste it into the
weblog:
<blockquote>
<code><b>
C-y
</b></code>
</blockquote>
yielding:
<blockquote>
<code>
&lt;a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/neill/neill-010607.html"><br>
If I have to Pay Reparations for Slavery . . .&lt;/a>
</code>
</blockquote>
Then copy Patti's name from the browser and enter it and the story
location:
<blockquote>
<code><b>
C-p C-a C-o C-y at LewRockwell.com -
</b></code>
</blockquote>
yielding:
<blockquote>
<code>
Patricia Neill at LewRockwell.com -<br>
&lt;a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/neill/neill23.html"><br>
If I have to Pay Reparations for Slavery . . .&lt;/a>
</code>
</blockquote>
Enter a few comments on the article yielding:
<blockquote>
<code>
Patricia Neill at LewRockwell.com -<br>
&lt;a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/neill/neill-010607.html"><br>
If I have to Pay Reparations for Slavery...&lt;/a> - If Patti is going<br>
to be taxed to pay for slavery, she is damn well gonna get some<br>
slaves. The black market will take care of it. Only, what will she do<br>
with slaves?
</code>
</blockquote>
Copy a quote from the article, and paste it in with a surrounding
blockquote:
<blockquote>
<code><b>
C-M-u
</b></code>
</blockquote>
yielding:
<blockquote>
<code>

&lt;blockquote><br>
It makes no logical sense to ask me to pay reparations for slavery<br>
unless I have personally indulged in slavery and caused some actual<br>
harm thereby. So if \"free money\" is to be made from my alleged<br>
\"white guilt,\" I think it only fair that I have something to be<br>
guilty of. And I plan to be plenty guilty before I'd be willing to<br>
allow any government silly enough to call me its \"subject\" to take<br>
my money for reparations for slavery.<br>
&lt;/blockquote>
</code>
</blockquote>
Finally, remember to give Lew credit by pasting in a source link (I
put square brackets around source links):
<blockquote>
<code><b>
C-p C-p C-p C-p C-p C-p C-p C-p C-p  M-] lew

yielding:

And one entry is done. It looks like this in the browser:
<blockquote>
Patricia Neill at LewRockwell.com -
<a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/neill/neill23.html">

Make a few more entries, and it's time to publish. Every time I
save with C-x C-s, BlogMax generates HTML and I check it out in the
web browser. Now I type C-x C-i to generate the index, check that out
in the web browser, and type C-0 C-x C-i to regenerate this month's
pages, the RSS channel, and upload everything via FTP.

Oops, I forgot to add a title. Do that, publish the page again, create
the index and upload it:
<blockquote>
<code><b>
M-< M-! Patti, Frog Farm Mirror, Radio Userland C-x M-s C-- C-1 C-x C-i
</b></code>
</blockquote>
The top of the page now looks like:
<blockquote>
<code>
&lt;!--Patti, Frog Farm Mirror, Radio Userland-->
</code>
</blockquote>
