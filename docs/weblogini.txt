If the file "weblog.ini" is in a directory on your disk, then that
directory is the root directory of a weblog site. After loading
{@blogmax.el}, every time you open a text file, your Emacs will look
for an ancestor of the file's directory containing a "weblog.ini"
file. If it finds one, the file's mode will be changed to
weblog-mode. All of the interactive commands in {@blogmax.el} also
look for the "weblog.ini" file to set up the environment in which the
macros are expanded.

Here's the "weblog.ini" file for this site. It contains an example of
each currently supported option and documents them pretty well. Adding
new options is easy, if you {jargon "grok"} Emacs lisp.
