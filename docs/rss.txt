This page tells you how to configure the template for creating RSS for
your site. RSS is a news syndication standard. BlogMax creates RSS
that is similar to that created by
<a href="http://radio.userland.com/">
Radio Userland</a>. By my limited understanding, this is not quite up
to the standard, but it appears to work.

Copy the
<a href="../rss-template.xml">
rss-template.xml</a> file from this site to your site's root
directory, and edit it to describe your site. Here's that file:
<blockquote>
{include "../rss-template.xml" t t}
</blockquote>
The part that you edit
is the text of the tags below the comment, "You need to customize this
information". BlogMax will fill in the "pubDate", "lastBuildDate", and
"item" tag information when it generates RSS. Currently, no
macro expansion is done during RSS file creation. I'll likely change
this at some point to allow for creation of different versions of RSS.
