This page documents weblog mode, accessible via the "weblog-mode"
Emacs command.
<p>
When you set a file to weblog mode, the auto-fill submode is
automatically turned on. If you don't like this, change the code. I
really really like this to be automatic.
<p>
Weblog mode inherits from HTML mode. Hence all of HTML mode's commands
are available. Even though you are editing ".txt" files, they are
really HTML, so HTML mode makes the most sense. Trust me.
<p>
You should rarely if ever need to explicitly use the weblog-mode
command, since ".txt" files in a weblog directory will be set to
weblog mode automagically.
<p>
The following commands are available in weblog mode. Key bindings are
included in parentheses. "M-" means that the meta key ("Alt" on
Windoze systems or an "Esc" prefix) is pressed along with the
following key. "C-" means that the control key is pressed along with
the following key. "C-M-" means that both the control and meta keys
are pressed along with the following key.
<p>
<b>weblog-insert-source-key (M-])</b><br>
Inserts the text "[{@}]", which is a shortcut between square
brackets, and positions the cursor to type the shortcut name. I use
this to link to sources of my stories.
<p>
<b>weblog-insert-shortcut (M-})</b><br>
Inserts the text "{@}", which is the macro for a shortcut, and
positions the cursor to type the shortcut name.
<p>
<b>weblog-insert-comment (M-!)</b><br>
Inserts the text "&lt!----&gt;" and positions the cursor in the middle
of the four dashes. A comment on the first line is how you tell
BlogMax the title of your stories, accessible via the {title} macro.
<p>
<b>weblog-yank-link (C-M-a)</b><br>
Insert a new link in the text with the last killed text (or copied
from another application) as the url for the "href" section of the
tag. For example, if I selected "http://billstclair.com/" in my web
browser and copied the text, then moved back to an Emacs page in
weblog mode and typed C-M-a, the following text would be inserted:
<blockquote>
&lt;a href="http://billstclair.com/"><br>
&lt;/a>
</blockquote>
The cursor is positioned before the closing "&lt;/a>", ready for
you to type the text that will clickable in the browser. It helps to
put links at the beginning of a line with another newline after the
first greater than sign. This prevents M-q from breaking in the middle
of the anchor tag. it also makes it easier to see where your links
are.
<p>
<b>weblog-yank-blockquote (C-M-u)</b><br>
Insert a blockquote section containing the most recently killed
text. For example, if I select "BlogMax Rocks!" in this web page and
copy it to the clipboard, then type C-M-u in a weblog mode Emacs page,
the following appears:
<blockquote>
&lt;blockquote><br>
BlogMax Rocks!<br>
&lt;/blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>weblog-save-both (C-x C-s)</b><br>
This patches the usual save buffer key binding. It saves the file just
as C-x C-s normally would, and then generates HTML for ".txt"
files. Even if the file doesn't need saving it generates
HTML. Sometimes you want to do this because you changed a template or
a shortcut.
<p>
<b>weblog-upload (C-x M-s)</b><br>
This saves the selected buffer, generates and uploads HTML if it is a
".txt" file, and then uploads the selected buffer itself. "Upload"
here means that it copies the file to the *weblog-ftp-directory* as
specified via the "ftp-directory" parameter in the
"<a href="weblogini.html">weblog.ini</a>" file. If the file is the
most recent day file, the rss.xml file is also generated and uploaded.
<p>
<b>weblog-upload-index (C-x C-i)</b><br> Generates the top-level
"index.html" file from the last *weblog-index-days* day files as
specified via the "index-days" parameter in the
"<a href="weblogini.html">weblog.ini</a>"
file. With a prefix arg of zero (C-0 C-x C-i), generates and uploads
the HTML for all the days in this month. You need to do this once per
day if your day pages have calendars. It's smart about regenerating
last month on the first page of the month. With a prefix arg of two
(C-2 C-x C-i), it generates and uploads the HTML for all the days in
the current buffer's directory and sub-directories. This is useful
after you change a template. Any other value of the prefix arg (except
1) will generate and upload the index file. Get used to using minus one
here (C-- C-1). I promise I won't change that one, though I may add
other prefix args above 2.
<p>
<b>weblog-add-shortcut (C-x C-a)</b><br>
Adds a shortcut to the "shortcuts.el" file and the *weblog-shortcuts*
alist in memory. Queries you for the name of the shortcut and the
shortcut itself. If you start the shortcut itself with an equal signe
("="), that text exactly will replace the shortcut. Otherwise, the
shortcut itself is interpreted as the url for a link and the name
becomes the underlined text.
<p>
Examples from this site's
<a href="../shortcuts.el">
shortcuts.el</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>Add Shortcut Named:</b> gnugpl<br>
<b>URL:</b> =&lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License&lt;/a>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now {@gnugpl} becomes &lt;a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License&lt;/a>
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>Add Shortcut Named:</b> PayPal<br>
<b>URL:</b> http://www.paypal.com/
</blockquote>
<p>
Now {@paypal} becomes &lt;a
href="http://www.paypal.com/">PayPal&lt;/a>.
<p>
Case does not matter when you invoke a shortcut, but the name's case
is remembered when you create a shortcut based on a URL.
<p>
<b>weblog-reload-shortcuts</b><br>
Reloads the "shortcuts.el" file for the weblog directory of the
current buffer. This is useful after you edit that file "by hand".
<p>
<b>weblog-month-index</b><br>
Generate the month index page for this day's month. This page is
automatically generated by weblog-upload-index if the "month-index"
flag is true in
<a href="weblogini.html">
weblog.ini</a>.
