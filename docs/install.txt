This page tells you how to install BlogMax in your Emacs and how to
set up your first web site.

The file {@blogmax.el} is all the code you need, in addition to Emacs
itself. If you byte compile it with byte-compile-file, or use the
distributed {@blogmax.elc}, it will load and run faster. Put both of
these files in the "lisp" sub-directory of your Emacs directory (or
anywhere else that you please). Now, add the following line to your
".emacs" file:
<blockquote>
<code>(require 'blogmax)</code>
</blockquote>
If you put {@blogmax.el} and {@blogmax.elc} in some directory other
than the Emacs "lisp" directory, e.g. "~/emacs-extensions/", then use
the following instead in your .emacs file:
<blockquote>
<code>(require 'blogmax "~/emacs-extensions/blogmax.el")</code>
</blockquote>
You can also load it explicitly with "M-x load-file" or by opening the
file in a buffer and doing "M-x eval-buffer". Usually, however, you'll
want to load it with <code>require</code> in your .emacs file.

To set up your first web site, pick or create a directory, and create
a
<a href="weblogini.html">
weblog.ini</a> file in that directory. The easiest way to do this is to
copy the
<a href="../weblog.ini">
weblog.ini file</a> from this web site into your directory, and then
edit it to describe your site.

Copy the
<a href="templates.html">
templates</a> files,
<a href="../page-template.tmpl">
page-template.tmpl</a>,
<a href="../content-template.tmpl">
content-template.tmpl</a>,
<a href="../day-template.tmpl">
day-template.tmpl</a>, and
<a href="../story-template.tmpl">
story-template.tmpl</a> to your site's root directory. Customize
them as you desire. The template files contain nothing specific to
this site, so you can use them as they are if you want your site to be
similar to this one. Well, almost nothing. The links in the left-hand
column are defined by
<a href="../side-links.inc">
side-links.inc</a>, which is included by
<a href="../page-template.tmpl">
page-template.tmpl</a>.

Then copy this site's
<a href="../rss-template.xml">
rss-template.xml</a> file to your site's root directory, and edit it
to describe your site, as documented on the
<a href="rss.html">
RSS</a> page.

Finally, copy this site's
<a href="../shortcuts.el">
shortcuts.el</a> file to your site's root directory. This file is
where the weblog-add-shortcut command (C-x C-a) stores new
shortcuts. It is an Emacs lisp file, so be careful when editing it by
hand.

You're ready to start blogging. The
<a href="dayinthelife.html">
Day in the Life</a> page will help you get started creating
content, but you'll probably want to read the rest of the
<a href="index.html">docs</a> as well.
