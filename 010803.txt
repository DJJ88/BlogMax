<!--BlogMax now works in XEmacs-->
BlogMax formerly used ange-ftp to upload files to the web site. It
appears that ange-ftp will run in XEmacs, but it isn't included by
default. Fortunately, efs <i>is</i> included in XEmacs and provides
much the same functionality as ange-ftp. I discovered this via
(apropos "ftp"), which showed up an instance of "ange-ftp" in the
bbdb-ftp command. Perusing the bbdb source revealed that efs can be
used in place of ange-ftp and a method to use to decide which one to
load. Then I had to do some hacking to prevent auto-fill from
indenting every line by two characters. The "define-derived-mode" for
"weblog-mode" now makes sgml-indent-step a local variable in the
buffer and sets it to nil. This means no normal HTML indenting will
happen in a weblog text file. I doubt anyone will notice. I didn't
play with it much in XEmacs, but it appears to generate html, create
an index, create an RSS file, and upload via FTP, at least to my local
Windoze FTP server.

I also added "previous | contents | next" links to the

Docs</a> pages.
