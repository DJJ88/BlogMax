<!--BlogMax is on GitHub-->
As you have noticed if you're following this blog, I haven't made any
changes to BlogMax in a long, long time. Actually, I made a few
changes up through February of 2007, when I was blogging at
imacpr0n.com (now defunct), so today I merged those into the main
source, and I pushed the whole thing to
<a href="https://github.com/billstclair/BlogMax">
github.com/BlogMax</a>. It's
<a href="docs/license.html">
GPL licensed</a>, so you're free to fork and make any changes you
want, as long as they remain free. If you DO make changes, please let
me know, so I can consider pulling them back into the main repository.
