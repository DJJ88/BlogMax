BlogMax is an Emacs major-mode for maintaining a weblog. It lets you
focus on the text of your web site, while wrapping a template that you
define around each page.

I haven't worked on BlogMax for over 3 years. I'm putting it on GitHub
to make it easier for others to fork and propose changes to this
central repository.
