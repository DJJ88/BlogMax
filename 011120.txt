<!--Calendar Macro Extended-->
In response to a user request, I have added a second optional
parameter to the <code>calendar</code> macro. It now takes two
optional arguments, <code>file</code> and
<code>start-day</code>. <code>file</code> defaults to the current
weblog story file. You will rarely if ever need to specify it. Use
<code>nil</code> to get the default. <code>start-day</code> is the day
of the week for the first column of the calendar. 0 is Sunday, 1 is
Monday, ..., 6 is Saturday. The default is 0, Sunday. Hence to put in
a calendar starting on Monday, you would place the following in one of
your template files:
<blockquote>
<code>\{calendar nil 1}</code>
</blockquote>
