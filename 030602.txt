<!--Some bug fixes-->
I've made a few small bug fixes and feature additions since my last
entry:
<ul>
<li>The month index code should now correctly update last month's
index on the first day of the month.
<li>Some common 8-bit characters are mapped to seven-bit. You can
extend this by changing *weblog-char-map*
<li>The RSS items no longer include a title or a link. Just the text
with whatever links are in it.
<li>The \{jargon} macro is updated for ESR's new directory
structure.
<li>C-M-R inserts "&lt;br>"
</ul>
