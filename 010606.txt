<!--BlogMax 0.9-->
I tried BlogMax in Emacs 20.4.1 running on Mandrake 6.1 (via
VMWare). It appears to work, though I didn't try everything. I'm gonna
call it version 0.9 and submit it to freshmeat. Hopefully, some Linux
folks will check it out and give me feedback on how well it works for
them. Hint. Hint. I added a missing &lt;/td> in the calendar, which
caused it to misbehave in Netspace 4.61.

My Caldera download never finished, and I couldn't figure out how to
aim VMware's virtual CD-ROM drive at an ISO image. I remembered that
Brian gave me a Linux disk a long time ago. Fortunately, I stashed it
in my laptop case.
