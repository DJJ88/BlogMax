<!--BlogMax 1.01-->
Hard to believe it's been almost a year since my last update. I use
BlogMax almost every day for my political blog
({@End the War on Freedom}). I've made some small changes to it over
the last eleven months, but I'm just now getting around to uploading
them.

I converted the three image files from GIF to PNG. Hopefully, this
will be good news to my Linux users.

<a href="weblog.ini">
weblog.ini</a> now includes some comments from
<a href=" http://jamesthornton.com">
James Thornton</a> on using
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tramp/">
Tramp</a> to do "scp" for the web site upload.
It also includes a new "month-index" flag, which controls whether a
monthly index page is generated and linked to the month name in the
output of the \{calendar}
<a href="docs/macros.html">
macro</a> (as you should see in the upper right-hand corner of this
page). The default is to generate the monthly index file.

I implemented
<a href="http://www.minority-report.co.uk/">
Tony Sidaway</a>'s suggestions, adding "alt" attributes to "&lt;img
...>" tags and "#" to the colors in the template files. I also removed
the final newline in "side-links.inc". The generated html should now
pass weblint, though it still uses tables for layout because I've been
too lazy to learn enough CSS to switch.

The \{calendar}
<a href="docs/macros.html">
macro</a> now makes the link to the previous or next month go to the
previous or next day file even if it's further away than a month.
