<!--Freshmeat Announcement-->
I created a new BlogMax project on FreshMeat. It got ID 15183 and
"has been stored for verification by the freshmeat crew". It will
likely appear soon at
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/blogmax/">

I changed weblog-upload a little. C-x C-i now creates the index, but
doesn't upload it. C-0 C-x C-i creates the index, regenerates html for
the month, and uploads. This is what to do when today's page is ready
for upload. C-2 C-x C-i creates and uploads the index and regenerates
html and uploads all text files in the current directory and its
sub-directories. This is useful after you change a template.

copy-file doesn't work for me in ange-ftp. I think it has something to
do with my web server provider's FTP server. Fortunately, save-buffer
DOES work, so that's what I use. I haven't figured out how to upload
binary files yet. I'd like C-3 C-x C-i to regenerate and upload the
entire site. If you can help...
