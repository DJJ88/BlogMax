      <description>&lt;!--BlogMax is on GitHub--&gt; 
As you have noticed if you're following this blog, I haven't made any 
changes to BlogMax in a long, long time. Actually, I made a few 
changes up through February of 2007, when I was blogging at 
imacpr0n.com (now defunct), so today I merged those into the main 
source, and I pushed the whole thing to 
&lt;a href="http://billstclair.com/blogmax/https://github.com/billstclair/BlogMax"&gt; 
github.com/BlogMax&lt;/a&gt;. It's 
&lt;a href="http://billstclair.com/blogmax/docs/license.html"&gt; 
GPL licensed&lt;/a&gt;, so you're free to fork and make any changes you 
want, as long as they remain free. If you DO make changes, please let 
me know, so I can consider pulling them back into the main repository.
