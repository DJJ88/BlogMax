<!--Bug Fix-->
A couple of people have experienced the error "End of file during
parsing" while saving a weblog page. This was due to not copying the
shortcuts.el file into the base directory. I updated the
<a href="docs/install.html">
Installation</a> page to remind people to do that, and beefed up the code
so that it will better handle a missing or malformed file.

I also added a
<a href="docs/blogs.html">
BlogMax Blogs</a> page to collect links to the known BlogMax sites.
